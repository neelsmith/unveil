# UnVEIL = Unified Verification of Editing In Latin

A gradle build system for automated validation and computer-assisted
verification of DSE editions of Latin texts.  It includes both generic
DSE validation, and analysis of the textual contents of editions in Latin.

## Requirements

UnVEIL uses Harry Schmidt's [parsley system](https://github.com/goldibex/parsley-core) for
parsing Latin, which in turn requires an installation of the [Stuttgart FST tools](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/SFST/).

UnVEIL is automatically installed in the HC MID Club's virtual machine for
editors of Latin texts.
