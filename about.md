UnVEIL is a [gradle](http://gradle.org/) build system that analyzes a repository of scholarly editions in Latin.

The `validate` task validates a single physical surface (such as a page of a manuscript) for:

- correct implementation of the "DSE triangle" relating citable text, physical artifact and documentary image
- morphologically valid forms of Latin text
- referential integrity of specificied classes of named entities

A series of HTML pages report the results of the analysis, and include visualizations for computer-assisted human verification of completeness of coverage of editing for a single physical surface, and of correct usage of named entity identifiers.
